# @4lch4/Dashboard

This repository is the home of [my personal dashboard][0], which is built using the [phntxx/dashboard][1] repository as the base/starting point. [I've forked the repository][2] with the intent to maintain it myself since I'll be making quite a few changes that I doubt the original author will want to be responsible for ðŸ˜…

At first I'll be doing a lift and shift from my [current dashboard][3], which is built using [dashy by Lissy93][4]. While dashy is a wonderful tool, I've found a few quirks with how it works that don't mesh well with my brain. As a result, I searched for an alternative and here we are, using the [pnthxx/dashboard repo][1] as my starting point.
